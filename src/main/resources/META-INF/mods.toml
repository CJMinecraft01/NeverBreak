Have you ever been in the middle of mining when suddenly your favourite enchanted diamond pickaxe has broken?
Have you ever been farming with your infamous diamond hoe and magically PUFF, it's gone into thin air?
Well, Never Break adds this sweet enchantment which you can add to your tools and armour which means that they will never break!!
Once the item has ran out of durability, the tool or armour becomes unusable until repaired once more so it's great to apply mending as well.
